"Design and implement a predictive maintenance system for air conditioning (AC) systems. The primary objective is to proactively monitor and analyze the performance of AC units, predict potential failures or issues, and schedule maintenance activities in advance to ensure optimal cooling, energy efficiency, and occupant comfort. The solution should leverage IoT sensors to reduce operational disruptions, increase the lifespan of AC units, and lower maintenance costs while ensuring a comfortable indoor environment."

To effectively monitor the performance and health of air conditioning units, a comprehensive system utilizing temperature, humidity, and dust sensors is employed. DHT11 sensors are strategically positioned at the evaporator and condenser coils to gather temperature and humidity data, while a dust sensor is installed at the air filters to monitor particulate matter levels. The collected sensor data is then transmitted to a centralized data repository and subsequently displayed on a user-friendly website for remote monitoring and analysis

Implementing predictive maintenance for air conditioning (AC) systems can have several significant impacts and benefits for both residential and commercial settings.  Here are some of the key advantages:Increased Reliability, Extended Equipment Lifespan,Energy Efficiency,Cost Savings,Improved Comfort and Indoor Air Quality,Customer Satisfaction and improve indoor comfort and air quality, all while enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of their air conditioning equipment.

Microcontroller:
 Arduino has been  used  for data collection, processing, and communication.
TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR:
 Temperature sensors are placed near the evaporator coil to measure the temperature of the air passing through the coil. These sensors can be strategically positioned on the intake and outlet sides of the coil.
     PARTICULATE MATTER (PM SENSOR):
 Optical Dust Sensors (e.g., Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F): Measures suspended particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10.
